# SLACKAutoIncReminder
<hr>
This repo contains scripts to find the AUTO_INCREMENT id's in the tables of a MySQL database and check whether they are nearing their end. If they are above a certain limit(defined in the script), an alert is sent to a SLACK channel with the use of their API's Incoming Webhooks.
